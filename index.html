    <h1>Welcome to the CONSPIR Survey</h1>

    <h2>What is CONSPIR?</h2>
    <p>

      <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/docs/ConspiracyTheoryHandbook.pdf">CONSPIR</a> CONSPIR is an acronym
      representing the seven traits of conspiratorial thinking.
      These traits describe common patterns found in conspiracy-oriented reasoning:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contradictory</strong>: Holding inconsistent or self-contradictory beliefs without recognizing the
        contradiction.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "The ice-caps are not melting! And the rise in temperature is not caused-by human
          activity!"</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Overriding suspicion</strong>: Excessive distrust of official sources, experts, or mainstream
        explanations.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "They say the vaccine is safe, but it's obviously a cover-up!'.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Nefarious intent</strong>: Assuming malicious motives behind events, actions, or policies without
        evidence.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "Mainstream media only serves the interests of the elites!"</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Persecuted victim</strong>: Believing oneself or one's group is being unfairly targeted or oppressed.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "Our country is being invaded by immigrants!"</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Immune to evidence</strong>: Dismissing or reinterpreting contradictory evidence to maintain existing
        beliefs.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "The footage of the moonlanding was faked and filmed in a Hollywood basement!"</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Re-interpreting randomness</strong>: Seeing patterns, connections, or meaning in random or coincidental
        events.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "These 5G towers gave me COVID!"</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>The CONSPIR Plug-in</h2>
    <p>
      Using the CONSPIR traits as a framework, we developped a broswer extension that examines online text-content, such
      as social media posts, articles, or comments, and scans for the presence of CONSPIR traits.

      The Plug-in's primary goal is to forewarn users about the presence of language indicative of conspiratorial
      thinking, before that content creates a conspiratorial belief. By highlighting the presence of CONSPIR traits, the
      extension
      aims to encourage more critical evaluation of the information being consumed.

    <h2>Purpose of this survey</h2>

    <p>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the usefulness and practicality of the CONSPIR Plug-in, as well as its
      ability to motivate users to think more critically about online content.
    </p>


    <h2>How the Survey Works</h2>
    <p>
      The survey is designed to compare your judgments with and without the assistance of the CONSPIR Plug-in.

      You will be shown a series of online posts and asked whether you think each contains conspiratorial content. The
      posts will alternate between rounds with the plug-in activated and without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will see a ✅ icon if it is a round where the plug-in is disabled.
    </p>

    <p>The survey is structured in two rounds. In the first round, you will be shown twitter posts, on rounds where the
      plug-in is activated,
      you will see a ⚠️ icon. Clicking on it will reveal the detected conspir traits.
    </p>

    <p>In the second round, long-form text will be shown (Reddit posts and articles). The Plug-in will analyse the
      sentences and highlight those with possible
      CONSPIR traits.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each question, you will be asked to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indicate whether or not you think the post shows certain conspiratorial traits</li>
      <li>Rate your confidence in your judgment</li>
      <li>Optionally, provide feedback if something seems unclear or ambiguous or if you have any comments or questions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may begin with a practice round to familiarize yourself with the plug-in or proceed directly to the main
      survey.
    </p>
    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <ul>
