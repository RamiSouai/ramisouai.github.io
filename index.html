    <h1>Welcome to the CONSPIR Survey</h1>

    <p>
Thank you for taking part in this research study. This survey is part of the CONSPIR project, an academic initiative at TU Darmstadt that investigates how people express and recognize cognitive markers of conspiracy thinking across different online domains.
    </p>

    <h2>What is CONSPIR?</h2>
    <p>
The CONSPIR framework is designed to identify and analyze patterns of language that commonly appear in conspiracy-related communication. It combines computational linguistics and social science insights to better understand how conspiracy narratives are formed, spread, and perceived.
As part of this research, we are developing systems that can automatically detect certain conspiratorial traits under the acronym CONSPIR: 

    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of This Survey</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate how useful the CONSPIR tool is in identifying and describing
      conspiratorial traits in online text.
    </p>
    <p>We want to understand whether the tool’s outputs make sense to human readers, and how well its classifications
      match your own intuition. We want to assess if the tool has an impact on belief formation.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Survey Works</h2>
    <p>
You will be shown a series of online posts. Once with the Plug-in on, and once without.
 For each post, you will be asked to:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indicate whether the post shows certain <strong>conspiratorial traits</strong></li>
      <li>Rate your <strong>confidence</strong> in each judgment</li>
      <li>Optionally, provide feedback if something seems unclear or ambiguous</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The survey takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.
      There are no right or wrong answers — we are interested in your perspective as a reader.
