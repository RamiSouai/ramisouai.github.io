    <h1>Welcome to the CONSPIR Survey</h1>

    <h2>What is CONSPIR?</h2>
    <p>

      <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/docs/ConspiracyTheoryHandbook.pdf">CONSPIR</a> is an acronym for
      "the seven traits of conspiratorial thinking", they are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contradictory</strong>: Holding inconsistent or self-contradictory beliefs without recognizing the
        contradiction.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "I don't trust mainstream media because it's always lying — but I only read headlines
          from that same network."</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Overriding suspicion</strong>: Excessive distrust of official sources, experts, or mainstream
        explanations.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "They say the vaccine is safe, but it's obviously a cover-up — never trust the 'experts'.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Nefarious intent</strong>: Assuming malicious motives behind events, actions, or policies without
        evidence.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "The city installed new streetlights — obviously they're tracking us to control
          behavior."</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Persecuted victim</strong>: Believing oneself or one's group is being unfairly targeted or oppressed.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "Everyone's out to get our community — they're banning our traditions on purpose."</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Immune to evidence</strong>: Dismissing or reinterpreting contradictory evidence to maintain existing
        beliefs.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "Even though multiple studies show otherwise, those results were paid for by corrupt
          interests."</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Re-interpreting randomness</strong>: Seeing patterns, connections, or meaning in random or coincidental
        events.
        <div><em>Example:</em> "Three celebrities tweeted the same phrase — it's proof they're coordinating a secret
          message."</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>The CONSPIR Plug-in</h2>
    <p>
      Using the CONSPIR traits as a framework, we developped a broswer extension that examines online text-content, such
      as social media posts,articles, or comments, and scans for the presence of CONSPIR traits.

      The Plug-in's primary goal is to forewarn users about the presence of language indicative of conspiratorial
      thinking, before that content creates a conspiratorial belief. By highlighting the presence of CONSPIR traits, the
      extension
      aims to encourage more critical evaluation of the information being consumed.

    <h2>Purpose of this survey</h2>

    <p>
      This survey aims to measure the Plug-in's usefulness and usabilitymeasure the real-world usefulness and
      usability of the
      CONSPIR Plug-in. Your participation will help us answer critical research questions, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How accurate is the Plug-in in detecting CONSPIR traits?</li>
      <li>Does plug-in invite the user to think critically about the content they're consuming?</li>
      <li>How usable is the Plug-in?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the Survey Works</h2>
    <p>
      This survey is structured to allow us to compare your judgment both with and without the aid of our tool. You
      will be presented with a series of online posts. For each post, you will be shown the content:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once without the CONSPIR Plug-in activated.</li>
      <li>Once with the CONSPIR Plug-in activated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For each instance, you will be asked to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indicate whether the post shows certain conspiratorial traits</li>
      <li>Rate your confidence in each judgment</li>
      <li>Optionally, provide feedback if something seems unclear or ambiguous</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please note that the first 3 questions are dedicated practice runs, to
      familiarize yourself with the Plug-in's interface and the rating process before starting the main section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.
      There are no right or wrong answers.
