    <h1>Welcome to the CONSPIR Survey</h1>

    <p>
      Thank you for taking part in this research study. This survey is part of the <strong>CONSPIR project</strong> — 
      an academic initiative at <strong>TU Darmstadt</strong> that investigates how people express and recognize 
      <strong>linguistic markers of conspiracy thinking</strong> across different online domains.
    </p>

    <h2>What is CONSPIR?</h2>
    <p>
      The CONSPIR framework is designed to identify and analyze patterns of language that commonly appear in 
      conspiracy-related communication. It combines computational linguistics and social science insights 
      to better understand how conspiracy narratives are formed, spread, and perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of this research, we are developing systems that can automatically detect certain 
      <em>conspiratorial traits</em> (such as excessive suspicion, contradictory reasoning, or claims of hidden intent)
      in online text.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of This Survey</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this survey is to evaluate how well our system aligns with human intuition. 
      By comparing your judgments with automated predictions, we can refine our models and 
      improve the accuracy and fairness of linguistic detection systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your responses will help us understand which language features humans perceive as 
      conspiratorial — and how these perceptions vary across different topics and contexts.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Survey Works</h2>
    <p>
      You will be shown a series of short online posts (e.g., tweets or comments).  
      For each post, you will be asked to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indicate whether the post shows certain <strong>conspiratorial traits</strong></li>
      <li>Rate your <strong>confidence</strong> in each judgment</li>
      <li>Optionally, provide feedback if something seems unclear or ambiguous</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The survey takes approximately <strong>10–15 minutes</strong> to complete.  
      There are no right or wrong answers — we are interested in your perspective as a reader.
    </p>

    <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your responses are collected anonymously and used solely for academic research.  
      No personally identifiable information is stored or shared.  
      You may withdraw from the survey at any time without any consequence.
    </p>
